        <h2> Exotic dances moves </h2>
        <p>
            <h4>
                Yes,you are right! As part of my post-doctrate work,i did study exotic tribule dances.To answer your question,my favourite dances are as follows with definitions
                <dl>
                    <dt> Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                    <dd> A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
                </dl>
                <dl> Iceland brownian shuffle</dl>
                <dd> Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,they used to practice this dance , which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor , and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking</dd>
                <dl>Arctic robot dance</dl>
                <dd>
                    An interesting example of historic misinformation.English explores in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic" , stilled movements , being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and canada . Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they wre really cold.
